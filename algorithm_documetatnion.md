### Algorithm input

A valid JSON input for the scheduling solver must contain the following fields. A sample input is provided in `input.json`:

## 1. General Parameters
- **Maximum hours per day** – defines how many class hours a group can have in a single day.  
- **Number of teaching days** – how many days per week classes take place.  
- **Scheduling goals** – a list of objectives used by the solver. Each goal has a **name** and a **weight in seconds**, representing its relative importance. The solver considers goals in the order given, from highest to lowest priority.

## 2. Student Groups
Each student group has:
- **ID** – identifier
- **Name**
- **Conflicting groups** – id's of groups that cannot have classes at the same time.  
- **Subjects** – list of subjects the group attends, including:
  - **Subject name**    
  - **Number of lessons** – the total number of lessons of this subject for the group.
  - **Type of class** – indicates scheduling constraints for the lesson:
    - **early** – should be scheduled in the earlier part of the day  
    - **late** – should be scheduled in the later part of the day  
    - **edge** – should be placed at the beginning or end of the schedule, at the “edges” of the day  
    - **unspecified** – no particular time preference
  - **Classroom requirements**:
    - **REQUIRED** – classrooms where the lesson must take place  
    - **FORBIDDEN** – classrooms where the lesson cannot take place  
    - **PREFERRED** – preferred classrooms if available  
    - **DISCOURAGED** – classrooms to avoid if possible  

## 3. Teachers
Each teacher has:
- **ID and name**  
- **Unavailability** – days and hours when the teacher cannot teach.  

### Algorithm output

A sample output is provided in `output.json`. This JSON represents the **scheduled timetable** generated by the solver and contains:

- **goals** – a list of objectives used by the solver, with:
  - **name**
  - **value**

- **classrooms** - a list of all avalivible classrooms

- **groups** – list of student groups, each with:
  - **group_id** – identifier  
  - **schedule** – a 2D array representing the weekly schedule of the group. Each inner array represents one day, and each element corresponds to a lesson slot. The lessons are represented by their subject names. `null` indicates an empty slot.  

- **teachers** – list of teachers, each with:
  - **teacher_id** – identifier  
  - **schedule** – a 2D array representing the weekly schedule of the teacher. Each inner array represents one day, and each element corresponds to a lesson slot. The lessons are represented by the **group_id** or class number they are teaching in that slot. `null` indicates the teacher is not teaching in that slot.
